# Everyday Nim

## Introduction

I have set a goal to learn the [Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org/) in 2023. Even though I worked with both Java and Python for many years before, I haven't written statically typed language for a while now. I might need some time to adjust to it.

## Main Goals

- [ ] Become proficient with core principles of the Nim
- [ ] Become proficient at Metaprogramming in Nim 
- [ ] Build better Data Processing pipeline/tools at [EXPA.AI](https://expa.ai)

I would also expect to build personal/fun projects along the way. Some of the projects that I have in my mind for now:
  - [ ] Build a new client for Expa.AI NLU Engine
  - [ ] Rewrite a `burmese` tokenizer and make it open source
  - [ ] Build a neural network from scratch

## Study Approach

For the first month, I would be studying Nim as follows:
- Set aside 1hr per day to play around with the basics
- Practice coding for 30 minutes per day
- Watch a general Nim knowledge video for an hour every two days

## Progress

### Week 1: Basics

This week, I focused on setting up my development environment for working with Nim. This included installing the Nim compiler, setting up my text editor, and familiarizing myself with the basic syntax and data types of the language. I practiced working with variables, constants, and various data types such as integers, floating point numbers, and strings. I also learned about Nim's type inference system and how to use it to my advantage. One challenge I faced this week was getting used to Nim's strict typing system, as it is different from languages I have worked with in the past.

## Future Plans

Moving forward, I plan to continue building upon my understanding of Nim's syntax and data types by working on more exercises and challenges. I also plan to start tackling the projects I have set for myself, starting with some of the fun and practical example projects from Nim Days. In addition, I am seeking a Nim study partner to collaborate with and learn from as I work on these projects. I will continue updating this thread.
